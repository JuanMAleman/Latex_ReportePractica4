\subsection{Conclusion Juan Manuel Manriquez Aleman}

In conclusion, developing this lab report allows us to strengthen our understanding of the topic and 
contributes both to learning new concepts and to the development of our final project in the Analog 
Electronics course. Being able to build the circuits, take measurements with the appropriate instruments, 
and also perform these same measurements and calculations theoretically and through simulation teaches us 
that, while we may have an idea of what to expect when building a circuit, we do not always work with 
ideal values. Therefore, we cannot know exactly what values or conditions will occur in our circuits 
until we assemble and test themâ€”in this case, in the electronics laboratory. I gained a great deal of 
knowledge from this practice and find myself increasingly interested and fascinated by the subject of 
Analog Electronics.
